When you're marketing B2B SaaS, you're not just slinging software at other companies. You're playing a completely different game. It's about seeing the entire customer journey—from the first click to the ten-year renewal—as one single, interconnected machine. This means blending smart demand generation with hyper-focused account-based marketing (ABM) and having an obsessive focus on getting users activated and keeping them happy.

But none of that works without a rock-solid technical foundation that ties your marketing, sales, and customer success data together.

## Your Blueprint for B2B SaaS Marketing Success

![A top-down view of a desk with a notebook showing gears and a mind map, coffee, laptop, and a plant. The text 'B2B SAAS BLUEPRINT' is overlaid.](https://cdn.outrank.so/f45919cb-f824-4ceb-a837-e4aa19dc066c/b39783cb-f9c3-4173-93aa-8f9a7daf9d65/b2b-marketing-saas-blueprint.jpg)

So, let's get into a real, practical playbook for **b2b marketing saas**. Forget the high-level fluff. This guide is all about the operational nuts and bolts—the stuff that actually matters for RevOps leaders, founders, and the marketing operators on the front lines. We’re going to look at the whole journey as one cohesive engine.

Think of it like building a high-performance race car. Your strategy is the collection of high-end parts, clean data pipelines are the fuel lines, and your metrics are the dashboard. If all three aren't working in perfect harmony, you're just spinning your wheels and burning cash.

### Unifying Strategy with Technical Execution

Here’s a hard truth: most marketing initiatives don’t fail because the ideas are bad. They fail because the execution is a mess of silos. Sales is working off one set of data, marketing is looking at another, and the customer success team is flying blind. The only way to fix this is with a unified RevOps and engineering mindset.

This approach makes sure every single touchpoint—from an ad view to a support ticket—is informed by a complete picture of the customer. It's about connecting your marketing automation platform to your CRM, and then plugging your product analytics into both to create a single source of truth. To really scale your growth, it is essential to develop [a robust SaaS product marketing strategy](https://submitmysaas.com/blog/saas-product-marketing-strategy) that nails both customer acquisition and retention.

> A modern B2B SaaS marketing function is built on an engineering foundation. Without reliable data pipelines and clean system architecture, even the most brilliant campaigns will fail to produce scalable results.

### Core Pillars of a Modern SaaS Marketing Engine

This guide will walk you through the core concepts, but more importantly, we’ll show you *how* a strong technical setup is the key that unlocks their full potential. We're focused on the "how," not just the "what."

Here's a sneak peek at what we'll be digging into:

*   **Systematic Demand Generation:** How to move beyond just hitting lead quotas and start creating genuine, lasting market interest.
*   **Data-Driven ABM:** Pinpointing your highest-value accounts and engaging them with personalized, automated campaigns that actually work.
*   **Engineered User Activation:** Designing seamless onboarding flows that guide new users straight to that "aha!" moment where they truly get your product's value.
*   **Proactive Retention & Expansion:** Using product usage data to spot opportunities and risks, ultimately boosting customer lifetime value (LTV).

Every strategy we'll discuss hinges on having reliable, accessible data. If you’re looking to build this kind of operational muscle, our guide on [data-driven marketing solutions](https://revopsjet.com/blog/data-driven-marketing-solutions) offers a much deeper look into the necessary infrastructure.

By the time you finish this blueprint, you'll understand why a solid technical backbone isn't just a "nice-to-have"—it's the ultimate competitive advantage in the B2B SaaS world.

## Orchestrating the B2B SaaS Customer Journey

![A man presents a customer journey map on a large screen to an audience in a business meeting.](https://cdn.outrank.so/f45919cb-f824-4ceb-a837-e4aa19dc066c/f5d0db66-1bcc-40f5-b51c-2ff992c2d3dd/b2b-marketing-saas-customer-journey.jpg)

Think of a winning **b2b marketing saas** strategy like a well-oiled machine. Every team—marketing, sales, product, customer success—has a critical role. If one gear grinds, the whole operation sputters. The aim is to create a smooth, intuitive experience that guides a prospect from "who are you?" all the way to "I can't work without you."

This journey isn't accidental; it's built around four key stages: Demand Generation, Account-Based Marketing (ABM), Activation, and finally, Retention and Expansion. Each stage sets the foundation for the next, creating a powerful growth engine that runs on smart data and even smarter operations.

To get a clearer picture of how this works in practice, let's break down the marketing funnel.

### SaaS Marketing Funnel Stages and Key Activities

| Stage | Primary Goal | Example Activities | Required RevOps Support |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Demand Gen** | Create broad awareness and interest | Content marketing, SEO, paid ads, community engagement | Lead routing, CRM data enrichment, attribution modeling |
| **ABM** | Target and engage high-value accounts | Personalized campaigns, targeted outreach, custom demos | Account scoring, intent data integration, sales/marketing alignment |
| **Activation** | Guide new users to their "aha!" moment | In-app onboarding, automated email sequences, product tours | Product usage data pipelines, triggered communications, PQL scoring |
| **Retention & Expansion** | Keep customers happy and grow their value | Proactive check-ins, usage monitoring, QBRs, upsell plays | Health scoring, renewal alerts, reverse ETL for CSMs |

This table maps out the core of your go-to-market motion. Success hinges on how well your RevOps team can support each stage with the right data, tools, and processes.

### Stage 1: Demand Generation

Demand generation is about playing the long game. It's not just about collecting a list of names for your sales team to call. It's about earning a reputation as the go-to expert in your space. The question isn't "who can we sell to today?" but rather, "how do we become the first company people think of when they have *this specific problem*?"

You do this by creating genuinely helpful content, showing up where your ideal customers are, and building a brand they trust. When you get this right, you fill your funnel with prospects who are already sold on your expertise, making every other step in the journey that much easier.

### Stage 2: Account-Based Marketing

Once you've built that broad market interest, Account-Based Marketing (ABM) lets you get laser-focused. ABM essentially flips the traditional funnel upside down. Instead of casting a wide net and hoping for the best, you handpick a list of dream accounts and treat each one like its own mini-market.

This is where a solid, unified data foundation is absolutely crucial. Sales and marketing have to be perfectly in sync, using the same data to orchestrate a personalized attack plan.

*   **Marketing’s Role:** Creates hyper-relevant content and ad campaigns that speak directly to an account's known pain points.
*   **Sales’ Role:** Uses the intel from marketing's efforts to start meaningful conversations with key players at exactly the right time.

A great ABM play doesn't feel like marketing at all; it feels like a genuinely helpful consultation. It's no wonder it dramatically boosts engagement with the accounts that matter most. And to get these efforts in sync, our guide on [marketing automation and social media](https://revopsjet.com/blog/marketing-automation-and-social-media) offers some great tips for connecting your tech.

### Stage 3: Activation

Getting a new customer to sign up is just the starting line. The activation stage is where they actually discover the value of your product. This is their "aha!" moment—that instant they realize your software is going to make their job, and their life, so much easier.

> A clunky onboarding experience is the quickest way to kill the momentum and lose a customer you just fought hard to win. Activation is all about delivering that core value as fast and painlessly as possible.

This is a huge priority for RevOps. It means using product-led signals—like a user completing a key task in the app—to trigger automated onboarding flows, helpful tips, or even a timely email from a success manager. This data-driven approach keeps users from getting stuck and guides them straight to the good stuff.

### Stage 4: Retention and Expansion

In SaaS, the real growth doesn't just come from landing new logos. It comes from keeping the customers you have and helping them grow with you. Retention and expansion are where the most profitable, sustainable revenue is made. It’s what separates the good companies from the truly great ones.

This final stage is all about maximizing customer lifetime value (LTV). By keeping a close eye on product usage data, your customer success team can spot accounts that are ready to upgrade or, just as importantly, those who might be at risk of churning. A tiny lift in retention can have a massive impact on your bottom line.

Recent benchmarks show just how critical this is. Private B2B SaaS companies saw a median growth rate of **25%** in 2024-2025, but that growth was directly tied to net revenue retention. In fact, **6.9%** of firms reported flat or negative expansion. This data from [SaaS Capital research](https://www.saas-capital.com/research/private-saas-company-growth-rate-benchmarks/) makes it clear: keeping and growing your customer base isn't just a good idea—it's essential for survival.

## The Metrics and SLAs That Actually Matter

It’s incredibly easy to get buried in B2B marketing data. Clicks, impressions, open rates… they’re all numbers, but they’re not the numbers that keep the lights on. If you want to build a revenue engine you can count on, you have to look past these vanity metrics. You need to focus on what truly shows the health and efficiency of your business.

We've moved beyond just counting Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs). Today, it’s about understanding the complete financial story of a customer—from what it costs to get their attention to the total value they bring over their entire time with you. These are your lagging indicators; they tell you how well you *did*. The real trick is building the operational backbone to shape these numbers proactively.

### The Core SaaS Financial Metrics

Let’s get real about the numbers every SaaS leader should have pinned to their dashboard. Be warned: calculating these accurately is impossible without clean, reliable data piped in from your CRM, marketing tools, and product analytics.

*   **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** This is your all-in cost to land a new customer. Simply take your total sales and marketing spend for a period and divide it by the number of new customers you brought in during that same window.

*   **Lifetime Value (LTV):** This metric forecasts the total revenue you can expect from a single customer over their entire relationship with your company. A quick way to estimate it is to take your Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA) and divide it by your customer churn rate.

*   **LTV to CAC Ratio:** This is the acid test for your business model. A healthy B2B SaaS company is aiming for a ratio of **3:1 or higher**. In other words, for every dollar you put into acquiring a customer, you should be getting at least three dollars back over their lifetime.

*   **CAC Payback Period:** How many months does it take to recoup the cash you spent to acquire a customer? You want this number as low as humanly possible, ideally under **12 months** for a typical venture-backed SaaS company.

Getting these numbers right means keeping a close eye on your spending. For a deeper look at what goes into these costs, resources like [Cost per Lead: Proven Benchmarks and Tactics to Cut Costs](https://www.adstellar.ai/blog/cost-per-lead) offer some great benchmarks for getting your acquisition spend in check.

### From Metrics to Actionable Agreements

Knowing your numbers is one thing. Getting your teams to rally around them is a whole different ballgame. That’s where Service Level Agreements (SLAs) come in. SLAs are basically promises between your marketing, sales, and customer success teams that spell out who does what, when, creating a smooth and predictable handoff process.

> Think of an SLA as a contract for collaboration. It stops people from working in silos and aligns them on a shared objective—revenue growth—by setting crystal-clear expectations for how leads and customers are handled at every single stage.

A smart SLA framework does more than just toss leads over the fence. It builds a vital feedback loop.

*   **Marketing-to-Sales SLA:** Marketing commits to delivering a specific number of qualified leads that fit a pre-agreed, data-backed definition. In return, sales commits to actually following up on those leads within a set timeframe (say, within **4 hours**).

*   **Sales-to-Success SLA:** Once a deal is won, sales promises to hand over a clean, complete record of the customer's goals and pain points. This makes for a much smoother onboarding and lays the groundwork for keeping that customer happy for the long haul.

These agreements are what turn abstract metrics into real-world action. They ensure that your LTV:CAC ratio isn't just a figure on a PowerPoint slide but the direct outcome of your teams working together, efficiently, across the entire customer journey. Without them, you're just measuring what happened yesterday instead of building a better tomorrow.

## Building Your RevOps Tech and Data Foundation

A world-class B2B SaaS marketing strategy is just a collection of good ideas until you have the right technology and data architecture to bring it to life. Without a solid foundation, even the most brilliant plans will crumble under the weight of messy data and disconnected systems. This is your blueprint for building that operational bedrock.

Your tech stack is so much more than a list of logos. Think of it as an interconnected ecosystem designed to create a single, reliable view of your customer. The core components—your CRM, a Marketing Automation Platform (MAP), a Customer Data Platform (CDP), and a data warehouse like [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)—must work together in perfect harmony.

### From Disparate Tools to a Single Source of Truth

The real goal isn't just to *have* these tools; it's to weave them together so data flows seamlessly between them. A lead’s journey might start in your MAP, move to the CRM upon qualification, and then get enriched with product usage data pulled from your warehouse. When these systems are siloed, you get nothing but data chaos.

This is why getting the data flow right is non-negotiable. Metrics like Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Lifetime Value (LTV), and Net Revenue Retention (NRR) are the lifeblood of a SaaS business, and they all depend on a unified data foundation.

![Process flow diagram showing key B2B SaaS metrics: Customer Acquisition Cost, Lifetime Value, Net Revenue Retention.](https://cdn.outrank.so/f45919cb-f824-4ceb-a837-e4aa19dc066c/b6eafae4-3a15-4446-b3fd-840a9be7af19/b2b-marketing-saas-saas-metrics.jpg)

As you can see, without clean, connected data, accurately calculating these vital metrics is basically impossible. You’re just flying blind.

### The Engineering Behind a Scalable Data Stack

Let’s be honest: point-and-click solutions can only take you so far. To build a truly scalable and reliable data foundation, RevOps leaders have to start thinking more like data engineers. This is where the real magic happens, turning raw, messy data into actionable intelligence.

Here are a couple of the key engineering concepts you absolutely need to get familiar with:

*   **Change Data Capture (CDC) Pipelines:** Think of CDC as a real-time listening device for your databases. Instead of slow, batch-based syncs that run overnight, CDC spots changes in your source systems (like a new lead in [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/)) and instantly replicates them to your data warehouse. This ensures your analytics are always based on the freshest data possible.

*   **Data Transformation with dbt:** Raw data from different systems is rarely consistent or clean. Tools like [dbt (Data Build Tool)](https://www.getdbt.com/) let you use simple SQL to clean, model, and transform that raw data into pristine, business-ready tables. It’s like turning a pile of raw ingredients into a perfectly prepared meal, ready for your analytics tools to dig in.

The need for this kind of engineered approach is exploding. In 2025, the global SaaS market hit an impressive **$300 billion** in revenue, and companies are now juggling an average of **106-275** SaaS applications each. This sheer complexity makes engineered solutions—like CDC pipelines syncing Salesforce to Snowflake and dbt models with lineage tracking—completely essential. As [this SaaS statistics report](https://zylo.com/blog/saas-statistics/) points out, without them, RevOps teams waste hundreds of hours on manual fixes and fighting with unreliable integrations.

### Activating Your Data with Reverse ETL

Okay, so you’ve got clean, modeled data sitting in your warehouse. Now what? The final, crucial step is to put it to work. This is where Reverse ETL comes in. It’s the "last mile" of your data journey, pushing valuable insights from your warehouse *back into* the frontline tools your teams use every single day.

> A calculated lead score or a customer health metric is useless if it’s trapped in a data warehouse. Reverse ETL is the bridge that makes your data actionable, turning insights into automated actions.

For example, a Reverse ETL tool can sync a newly calculated Product-Qualified Lead (PQL) score from Snowflake directly into a custom field in your CRM. This simple action can instantly trigger an automated sales sequence or alert a sales rep, ensuring no opportunity ever falls through the cracks. It closes the loop, transforming your data warehouse from a passive reporting tool into the active, operational hub of your entire GTM motion.

Understanding this process is a game-changer for modern RevOps. If you want to dive deeper, we have a whole guide explaining [what is Reverse ETL](https://revopsjet.com/blog/what-is-reverse-etl) and why it's becoming so critical for marketing and sales teams.

## Avoiding Common B2B SaaS Marketing Pitfalls

Even the sharpest marketing strategy will fall flat if the execution is a mess. When you’re dealing with the complexities of B2B SaaS, sloppy processes and technical gaps can completely sink your campaigns before they even get a chance to work.

<iframe width="100%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_eOZFlFlGok" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Let's dig into the most common traps I see teams fall into and how a little bit of smart engineering can pull you out of the quicksand.

So many RevOps teams are handed a CRM that’s an absolute maze of old, unused fields and convoluted page layouts. This isn't just an annoyance; it actively slows people down and completely torpedoes the accuracy of your reporting.

The first order of business is usually tackling that CRM technical debt.

### CRM Technical Debt Issues

A tangled-up CRM is like having crossed wires in a factory—sooner or later, you're going to get some pretty unpredictable short circuits. When your system logic is a mess, automation rules start firing at the wrong time, lead scoring breaks down, and everything grinds to a halt.

You know you're in deep when you see symptoms like these:

- **Duplicate records** that make your lead counts look way better than they are.
- **Painfully slow load times** that have your sales reps ready to throw their laptops out the window.
- **Broken workflows** that trigger at the worst possible moment, or not at all.

To start untangling this, you need to treat your CRM like a proper piece of software. Audit all your metadata and get ruthless about deleting stale, unused fields. From there, you can start refactoring your automation logic into clean, testable scripts. Think of it as introducing version control and peer reviews for your CRM.

### Fragile API Integrations

Data chaos is almost always rooted in brittle, unreliable API connections between your tools. All it takes is for one of your vendors to push a small change to their data structure, and suddenly, your entire pipeline breaks.

When that happens, what do people do? They fall back on manual CSV exports and spreadsheets, which is not only slow but also incredibly risky.

> Manual middleware is a ticking time bomb that erodes ROI.

You have to build more resilience into your integrations. A great way to do this is by wrapping your API calls with smart logic like retry mechanisms, schema validation, and idempotent webhooks. Specifically:

1.  Use **exponential backoff** to handle rate limits gracefully.
2.  Implement **payload checks** to catch unexpected schema changes before they cause havoc.
3.  Design for **idempotency** to prevent creating duplicate records if a webhook fires twice.

Taking these steps will dramatically cut down on the time your team spends firefighting and finally give you a reliable flow of data.

### Neglecting Pipeline Monitoring

Having blind spots in your data pipelines (whether they're ETL or CDC jobs) is a recipe for disaster. It leads to stale segments and outdated information, which means your campaigns end up targeting people with the wrong message at the wrong time—a complete waste of budget.

A few key monitoring tactics can save you a world of hurt:

- **Detailed logs** that provide clear context when an error occurs.
- **SLA alerts** that ping you when a data sync is taking too long.
- **Data freshness dashboards** that give you an at-a-glance view of your pipeline's health.

The trick is to integrate these alerts directly into your team's workflow, whether that's in Slack or [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/), so they can jump on issues immediately. This is how you keep small failures from turning into massive problems.

### Over-Reliance on Manual Processes

Putting humans in the loop is often a temporary patch, not a long-term fix. People end up plugging holes instead of addressing the root cause, and that's just not scalable.

The data backs this up. A staggering **36.3%** of B2B SaaS companies generated zero self-serve revenue in 2025, even though self-serve motions deliver nearly twice the profitability (**68%** vs. **36.4%**). You can learn more about this self-service gap on ProductLed or read the full research about self-serve motions.

It's time to streamline those repetitive tasks with simple Python scripts or a tool like [n8n](https://n8n.io/). Automating things like record enrichment, data cleanup, and error handling frees your team from the soul-crushing work of manual exports.

- Set up **scheduled jobs** for regular data syncs and clean-up routines.
- Create **automated notifications** for any pipeline failures.
- Build **scripted remediations** that can run automatically to fix common issues.

When you free your team from constant firefighting, you unlock a huge amount of efficiency and drive more consistent results.

### Example Case Study

Here’s a real-world example: A midmarket SaaS company I worked with managed to slash their pipeline errors by a whopping **75%** after refactoring their CRM validations.

They rebuilt their outbound webhooks to include retry logic and used automated scripts to clean up years of stale data. The result? They boosted their lead throughput by **40%**.

- Webhook error rate plummeted from **12% to 3%**.
- Daily sync backlogs went from **5,000 to just 200**.
- The marketing ops team got back **20 hours per week**.

This is a perfect illustration of how targeted engineering fixes can drive real, measurable improvements and a solid ROI.

By refactoring your CRM logic, hardening your APIs, monitoring your pipelines, and automating away the manual drudgery, you can sidestep the execution traps that derail so many B2B marketing efforts. These kinds of engineering solutions ensure every moving part of your marketing machine runs like clockwork.

While your rivals are stuck in the mud, your engine will be humming along. Once these pitfalls are gone, your teams can finally collaborate using clean data and reliable automations. Campaign analysis becomes straightforward, and you can shift your focus to what really matters: scaling your high-ROI channels.

For any leader serious about consistent growth, investing in these kinds of engineered solutions isn't just a good idea—it's non-negotiable. Start by auditing your most error-prone processes and apply a few small code fixes. Over time, these changes compound, creating a robust, self-healing marketing engine.

Your growth engine is now battle-tested. Go enjoy that predictable scaling.

## Got Questions About Your B2B SaaS Marketing Stack? Let's Dig In.

Alright, let's get real. Talking about high-level strategy is one thing, but making it all work is another. The gap between a great marketing plan and a growth engine that actually fires on all cylinders is usually filled with messy data, technical hurdles, and some tough, practical questions.

These aren't just minor speed bumps; they're the roadblocks that can completely derail your progress and waste a ton of money. So, let's tackle the big ones I hear all the time from RevOps and marketing leaders in the trenches.

### "We Need a Data Foundation, But We Can't Afford a Full-Time Data Engineer. What Do We Do?"

This is probably the most common catch-22 for growing companies. You know you need clean, reliable data pipelines to fuel your marketing, but the six-figure price tag for a senior data engineer just isn't in the budget. It feels like you're stuck between a rock and a hard place.

The good news? You don't have to be. The smart move here is to look for a flexible, on-demand engineering service. Instead of taking on the massive commitment of a full-time hire, you can partner with a specialized technical team for a flat monthly fee. This gives you instant access to folks who live and breathe this stuff—building CDC pipelines, writing tricky SQL, and getting [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) models humming.

> Think of it this way: you get all the benefits of a senior-level engineering team—rock-solid infrastructure, great documentation, and ongoing support—without the overhead and six-month hiring headache. It's the perfect way to bridge that expertise gap.

This frees up your team to focus on what they do best: strategy and execution. You can move forward with confidence, knowing the data foundation beneath you is solid. Honestly, it's the fastest way to save hundreds of engineering hours and sidestep the expensive mistakes that come from winging it.

### "What Exactly is Reverse ETL, and Why Does Everyone Keep Talking About It?"

Great question. In simple terms, **Reverse ETL** is the magic that makes your data useful. It’s the process of taking all the rich, beautifully cleaned data from your central data warehouse (like Snowflake or BigQuery) and piping it *back into* the tools your teams use every day—think [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/), HubSpot, or Marketo.

Imagine your warehouse has the perfect, data-science-approved lead score for every person in your database. Awesome, right? But if that score just sits in a BI dashboard, it’s a vanity metric. It’s an interesting piece of trivia, not something that helps you close deals.

**Reverse ETL** is the "last mile" that turns insights into action. Here’s what that looks like in the real world:

*   A new lead score gets calculated in the warehouse and is instantly synced to a field in Salesforce, triggering an alert for the right sales rep to follow up.
*   A list of users who just unlocked a key feature gets pushed to your marketing tool, automatically enrolling them in a targeted upgrade campaign.
*   A customer’s health score drops, and that data is sent to your customer success platform, creating a high-priority ticket for their account manager.

Without it, you have a massive disconnect between your best data and your team's ability to act on it. **Reverse ETL** is the bridge that transforms your data warehouse from a dusty library for reports into the living, breathing operational hub of your entire go-to-market strategy.

### "Our CRM is a Mess of Technical Debt. How Do We Even Start to Fix It?"

You're not alone. CRM technical debt is the silent killer of GTM productivity. It shows up as painfully slow load times, data that’s just plain wrong, and a maze of automations that nobody dares to touch for fear of breaking everything. Slapping on more band-aids and workarounds only digs the hole deeper.

The only way out is to start treating your CRM like a real software product. That means taking an engineering-first approach to cleaning it up.

First, you need a deep audit to map out all the tangled code, fragile automations, and duplicate fields that are gumming up the works. Once you know what you're dealing with, you can start systematically refactoring that mess into something clean, documented, and maintainable.

For example, that monstrous workflow rule that’s been built up over five years? It needs to be rewritten as clean Apex code that can be version-controlled and properly tested. Those custom integrations that keep failing? They need to be rebuilt with modern error handling and monitoring.

> Your CRM isn’t just an admin tool; it's a critical piece of software. It deserves version control, automated testing, and clear documentation—not just one-off fixes and prayers.

This is a heavy lift, and it's often more than a typical admin is equipped to handle. It’s the perfect job for a technical RevOps service with the engineering discipline to pay down that debt, piece by piece. Getting your CRM back to a high-performance state is absolutely fundamental for any **b2b marketing saas** program to succeed.
